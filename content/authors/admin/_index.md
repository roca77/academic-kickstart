Welcome to my portfolio! I currently lead a Machine Learning project at OCAD Univerisity in Toronto, where I manage an international team to analyze tribal scars from the Great continent of Africa. One of the objective of the project is to allow researchers to learn about the scars and their links to slave trade. 

When I am not working on Machine Learning, I might be building a Natural Processing Language application, analyzing retails data for upselling opportinities, or building a Dashboard to data vizualization.

With my unique background in Programming, Finance, Operation Business Analysis, I would like to join a team with a goal of making significant positive impact, delivering game changing data products.
